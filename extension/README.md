# Timey Wimey time tracker - the simple solution to tracking your coding time

This extension tracks your working time (that is time spend typing and time with your editor focused) per workspace, per file and even per commit! Not only that, you can even add a custom tracker to track whatever you'd like! (under construction lol)
